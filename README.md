# Sales-Analysis
In this data analysis project using Python Pandas and Matplotlib, I delved into 12 months of sales data from an electronics store, comprising details such as product types, costs, purchase addresses, and more.

The initial focus was on data cleaning, where I performed tasks such as:
- Removing rows with missing values (NaN)
- Filtering out rows based on specific conditions
- Converting column types (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

After cleaning, I proceeded to explore the data to answer key business questions:
1. **Best Month for Sales and Earnings**: Determined the month with the highest sales and calculated the revenue earned during that period.
2. **Top Selling City**: Identified the city that sold the most products.
3. **Optimal Advertisement Timing**: Explored the best times to display advertisements to increase the likelihood of customer purchases.
4. **Commonly Sold Together Products**: Analyzed which products are frequently purchased together.
5. **Best-Selling Product**: Identified the product that had the highest sales volume and speculated on the reasons behind its popularity.

This analysis enabled me to gain valuable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and strategic advertising opportunities, contributing to data-driven decision-making for the electronics store.
